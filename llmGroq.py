Below is a bank statement. Ignore all text that is not in the transaction table. Extract all the transaction information and put each transaction in a JSON format.
The position of the text is preserved as it would appear in the original document.
The table for the transactions are in columns. Each column should be a separate field in the JSON.
If there are no transactions in the page then ignore it and do nothing.
Analyze the provided text. Find out individual transactions.


The line may have values missing in 'Money In' or 'Money Out', but at least one value and the balance is always present. If any field has missing values then still include the field and keep the value empty. There may also be the same description for multiple lines. This is correct do not skip the line out.

Only give the JSON object without any additional text or explanation.
Here are the transactions:
